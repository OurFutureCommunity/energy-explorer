    Current Best Practice: Increased Density and Building Code
  </h1>

    <h2>In this scenario, the neighbourhood develops to become compact and complete, with extensive mid-rise mixed-use buildings
    compplemented by a new large park. This development follows the Cityâ€™s official community plan, and all buildings are
    built to the current building code. More jobs locate within the neighbourhood and it is more walkable for residents.
    All of these changes greatly reduce per capita greenhouse gas emissions.</h2>
