  <h1 style="color:black">Revelstoke Interactive Planning Workshops: Citizen Engagement Process</h1>
  <h4>The Revelstoke workshops presented an opportunity to evaluate a novel, interactive approach to citizen engagement in neighbourhood
    planning and design. Using the UD Co-Spaces planning support tool, residents were able to interactively design and evaluate
    options for two neigbourhood sites within their city. Researchers then analyzed the performance of the citizen designs
    and provided an opportunity for residents to modify their designs based on new greenhouse gas emissions information.</h4>
