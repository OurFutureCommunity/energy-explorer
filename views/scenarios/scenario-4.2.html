    Suburban Single Family Neighbourhood

    <h2>This option accomodates growth by expanding the town boundary and converts undeveloped land to urban uses requiring construction
      of new municipal infrastructure (roads, utilities, schools etc.). Suburb is the least efficient option, housing 500
      people within the largest land area â€” over 5 times greater than that of the Downtown option. With no services, walkability
      in this neighbourhood is poor, and single family houses are much less energy efficient than multi-family forms.</h2>
