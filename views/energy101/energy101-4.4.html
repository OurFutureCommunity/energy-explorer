          reduce or eliminate costs & price fluctuations of natural gas or other non-renewable heat sources.</h6>

        <h6>Horizontal geoexchange fields can take up a lot of space, so may be difficult to install in areas that are already
          developed and have mature trees. Existing home heating systems must also be compatible with the geoexchange heat
          pumps.

        <h4><b>The City of Richmond</b> has constructed its first city-owned district energy utility with a vertical geoexchange
          system. The first phase, developed in partnership with Oris Geo Energy Ltd., uses thermal energy from the ground
          to heat and cool new residential units currently being built in Richmondâ€™s West Cambie neighbourhood. It could
          cut local production of greenhouse gas emissions by 200 to 600 tonnes annually.</h4>
        <h4>The first phase is expected to cost $3.5 million to construct and $80,000 to operate annually at full capacity.
          All of these costs will be recovered over time through user rates, and will place no burden on Richmond taxpayers
          who are not serviced by the utility.</h4>
