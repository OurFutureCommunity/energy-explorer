      <h2>
        Communities across the region use different total amounts of energy for electricity, heating, and transportation. We also
        consume different amount of energy per person across the region, depending on which municipality we live in (due
        to their housing types, land uses, transport options, and energy/climate change policies). Understanding how much
        communities rely on energy use is refers to energy demand. There are many ways to see energy, including the energy
        use (intensity and cost) and GHG (emission and intensity).

        region, and describes issues arising from the associated technologies. However it does not reflect constraints of
        economic viability, social acceptability or current regulations. Existing data from various sources are analyzed
        and mapped using new techniques suitable to communicating energy resources at a regional scale.

        It uses the earth as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate
        temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and
        may be combined with solar heating to form a geosolar system with even greater efficiency. They are also known by
        other names, including geoexchange, earth-coupled, earth energy systems.

      <h2>
        Water heat recycling (also known as sewage heat recovery, drain water heat recovery, wastewater heat recovery, greywater
        heat recovery, or sometimes shower water heat recovery) is the use of a heat exchanger to recover energy and reuse
        heat from wastewater. This can be done at large scale (as in sewage heat systems) down to household systems for heat
        recovery from activities such as dish-washing, clothes washing and especially showers. The technology is used to
        reduce primary energy consumption for water heating.
